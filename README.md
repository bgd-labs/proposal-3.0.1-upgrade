# Aave 3.0.1 upgrade proposal

## Process

To figure out which contracts require an update and which don't we compared the contracts of `Aave V3 Polygon` with the contracts deployed on `Aave V3 Ethereum`.
Upon closer inspection the following contracts should be upgraded in the v3.0.1 upgrade process:

- AAVE_PROTOCOL_DATA_PROVIDER
- POOL_CONFIGURATOR
- POOL
- A_TOKEN_IMPL
- VARIABLE_DEBT_TOKEN_IMPL
- STABLE_DEBT_TOKEN_IMPL

You can find the full diffs in the [diffs](./diffs/) folder.

The `AAVE_PROTOCOL_DATA_PROVIDER` is not upgradable, but is only referenced on the `PoolAddressesProvider`, so the proposal will just update the address.
The `POOL` and `POOL_CONFIGURATOR` are upgradable and can be upgraded by the `PoolAddressesProvider`.
The `A`, `VARIABLE_DEBT` and `STABLE_DEBT` - token implementations are upgradable and can be upgraded by the `PoolConfigurator` and need to be upgraded per token.

We then created a generic proposal payload which can be reused across all pools & networks.
The [generic payload](./src/contracts/V301UpgradePayload.sol) needs to be executed via `delegatecall` by the `cross-chain-executors` or `guardians` of the respective networks.
Upon execution the payload will perform all the implementation upgrades & replace the `AAVE_PROTOCOL_DATA_PROVIDER` reference.
The v3.0.1 upgrade introduces a new `flashloanable` configuration boolean per asset, as this value resides on a previously unused storage space, if will default to `false` effectively disabling flashloans. Therefore to create the proposal in a non-breaking manner, it will also set `flashLoanable` to `true` for all assets.
To keep the proposal execution within reasonable gas limits, the generic `V301UpgradePayload` expects to be initialized with [pre-deployed implementations](./scripts/DeployPayloads.s.sol).

As `Polygon`, `Optimism` and `Arbitrum` are controlled by crosschain-Governance, the [Proposal](./scripts/CreateProposal.t.sol) will forward execution to these 3 chains. For the other ones, a successfull Proposal will be seen as signal to coordinate the upgrade with respective guardians.

## Diff summary

Therefore the proposal upgrades:

- **AAVE_PROTOCOL_DATA_PROVIDER**: There are relevant changes in regards to `flashloanable`

- **POOL_CONFIGURATOR**: There are relevant changes in regards to `flashloanable`

- **POOL**: There are relevant logic changes

- **A_TOKEN_IMPL**: There are relevant changes in regards to events and libraries

- **VARIABLE_DEBT_TOKEN_IMPL**: There are relevant changes in regards to events and libraries

- **STABLE_DEBT_TOKEN_IMPL**: There are relevant changes in regards to events

Upgrades that were skipped as they seem unnecessary:

- **ACL_MANAGER**: only changes are in unused parts of libraries and documentation

- **COLLECTOR/COLLECTOR_CONTROLLER**: are currently not tied to a protocol version and will be aligned in a different proposal

- **RESERVE_INTEREST_RATE**: there are method visibility changes, which are irrelevant for existing reserves and we think it's reasonable to migrate over time organically

- **EMISSION_CONTROLLER**: only changes are in documentation

- **ORACLE**: only changes are in unused parts of libraries and documentation

- **POOL_ADDRESS_PROVIDER_REGISTRY**: only changes are in unused parts of libraries and documentation

- **WETH_GATEWAY**: only changes are in unused parts of libraries and documentation

## Scripts

To identify differences between the deploy `3.0.0` and the new `3.0.1` version of the aave protocol the `node diff.js` utility generates a code diff between `AaveV3Ethereum` and `AaveV3Polygon`.
Therefore we took all relevant addresses from `AaveAddressBook` downloaded their source from etherscan/polygonscan and diffed them. Checkout [diff.js](./diff.js) for reference.

## Security procedures

### Configuration snapshots

1. We generated configuration snapshots from before proposal execution.
2. Simulated the proposal execution on a fork & generated a new configuration snapshot.
3. Diffed them to ensure only the desired parts have changed.

### Storage layout

To be done

### E2E tests

We simulated the proposal execution and afterwards ran our E2E test suite, covering supply, withdraw and borrow of all listed assets on a respective pool.

## Development

This project uses [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh). See the [book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html) for detailed instructions on how to install and use Foundry.
The template ships with sensible default so you can use default `foundry` commands without resorting to `MakeFile`.

### Setup

```sh
cp .env.example .env
forge install
```

### Test

```sh
forge test
```
